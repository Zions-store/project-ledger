# Unity Project Analysis Rules

## Signature Detection
- `Assets/` directory exists
- `ProjectSettings/` directory exists
- `.unity` files (scene files) present
- `Packages/manifest.json` present

## Scan Steps

### 1. Read Package Dependencies
```bash
read Packages/manifest.json
```
Extract key packages and their purposes:
- `com.unity.render-pipelines.universal` → URP
- `com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition` → HDRP
- `com.unity.inputsystem` → New Input System
- `com.unity.cinemachine` → Camera system
- `com.unity.textmeshpro` → Text rendering
- `com.unity.timeline` → Cutscene system
- `com.unity.netcode.gameobjects` → Netcode for GameObjects
- Other `com.unity.*` packages → Unity official
- Non-`com.unity` packages → Third-party

### 2. Map Directory Structure
Use `glob` to list `Assets/` subdirectories. Common patterns:
- `Assets/Scripts/` → Game logic (scan for `*Manager.cs`, `*Controller.cs`, `*Singleton.cs`)
- `Assets/Scenes/` → Scene files (identify `*MainMenu*.unity`, `*Start*.unity`)
- `Assets/Prefabs/` → Reusable GameObjects
- `Assets/Art/` or `Assets/Sprites/` → Visual assets
- `Assets/Audio/` → Sound files
- `Assets/Animations/` → Animation clips/controllers
- `Assets/Resources/` → Runtime-loadable assets
- `Assets/Settings/` → URP/HDRP pipeline assets
- `Assets/Plugins/` → Native libraries

### 3. Find Entry Scenes
```bash
glob **/Scenes/*.unity   or   glob **/*.unity
```
Read Build Settings to find scene build order:
```bash
grep "scenes" in ProjectSettings/EditorBuildSettings.asset
```

### 4. Find Core Scripts
```bash
grep "class.*Manager\|class.*Controller\|class.*GameManager\|class.*Singleton" in Assets/Scripts/
```
Read top 50 lines of each core script to extract class name and purpose.

### 5. Identify Patterns
- ECS (Entity Component System)? → Look for `SystemGroup`, `ISystem`
- MVC? → Look for `View`, `Controller`, `Model` naming
- Singleton managers? → Very common in Unity projects
- Event-driven? → Look for `UnityEvent`, `Action`, `delegate`
- Dependency injection? → Look for `[Inject]` attribute, Zenject/VContainer

### 6. Check Special Files
- `.meta` files: GUID references, ignore for analysis (just note they exist)
- `.asset` files: ScriptableObject data
- `.prefab` files: YAML format, note but don't deep-read (can be very large)
- `.unity` files: Scene data, YAML format, note entry scenes only

### 7. Build & Run Commands
- **Run in Editor**: Open the project in Unity Hub → Select version → Open
- **Build**: File → Build Settings → select platform → Build
- **Test**: Unity Test Framework (Window → General → Test Runner)
- **Package Manager**: Packages managed via `Packages/manifest.json` (auto-resolved by Unity)

## AGENTS.md Additions for Unity
Include:
- Render pipeline in use (Built-in/URP/HDRP)
- Input system in use (Old/New)
- Whether Netcode is present
- Scene loading order
- Singleton pattern warnings: "If you see DontDestroyOnLoad + singleton, this is the global state manager"
